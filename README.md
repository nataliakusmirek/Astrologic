# Astrologic
A command-line program using Python that outputs a user's horoscope based on their birthday.

   Astrologic was thought of on a whim after I learned the basics of Python. A week later, I started creating this. At the time of this upload, I am a sophomore and self-taught in high school.
   
   To run Python scripts with the python command, you need to open a command-line and type in the word python , or python3 if you have both versions, followed by the path to your script, just like this: $ python3 astrologic.py
