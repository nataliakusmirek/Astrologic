# Astrologic
A command-line program using Python that outputs a user's horoscope based on their birthday.

   Astrologic was thought of on a whim after I learned the basics of Python. A week later, I started creating this. At the time of this upload, I am a sophomore and self-taught in high school. 
   
   This project took a few weeks to write because of the month/day algorithm that had to be created, based on each horoscopes birthday date frame. Each loop consists of the month and day range of each horoscope. However, when first drafting, I had trouble making sure that any horoscopes that overlapped in months would not output both of them to the user, just one. For example, Aquarius and Sagittarius share January, but if a user is born as an Aquarius, it would print both not just that one. After a few hard hours it finally worked, and I had to alter the same concept to stop a overlap to every loop.
   
   With all these numbers I wanted to add a touch of creativity, so I added a line of code that would say "Scanning the universe now" as the code would calculate the users' horoscope, just to contrast the constant numbers.
   
 
 
 To run Python scripts with the python command, you need to open a command-line and type in the word python , or python3 if you have both versions, followed by the path to your script, just like this: $ python3 astrologic.py
